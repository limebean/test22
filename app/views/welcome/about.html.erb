                <p>Our mission is to ensure that every child has access to a home away from home that helps them realize their full potential.</p>
                <p>We work with experienced educators and childcare providers to help them  start their own childcares or preschools out of their homes, whether they live in apartments, condos, or homes that they rent or own.</p>
                <p>We provide assistance with licensing, program setup, marketing and everything in between. Our software platform allows teachers to manage their students, parents, and their program from one dashboard. Along with this, we have built a marketplace for parents to search Dreamschool programs, schedule visits, enroll their children, and make payments.</p>

                  <p>Chris Bennett and Arrel Gray saw too many parents who were anxious and scared about finding childcare, as well as educators who couldn’t afford care for their own children while they were at work. They knew that there had to be a better way to address this issue for families and teachers alike.</p>
                  <p>Chris’s appreciation for education goes back to his parents, Honduran immigrants who did whatever they could to ensure that he had access to an excellent education—from attending quality preschool to graduating from Penn. He wanted to ensure other children had the same opportunities to reach their full potential.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, new father Arrel struggled to find care for his toddler near his home in Los Angeles. He visited many preschools, but had no idea how to evaluate them and what sources to trust to determine a program’s credibility.</p>
                  <p>Chris and Arrel designed Wonderschool, a mission driven company, as a way to dramatically increase access to high-quality early childhood care for all families. Today, the platform empowers experienced educators and child care providers to run their own in-home business while providing a much-needed service to other families in their communities.</p>

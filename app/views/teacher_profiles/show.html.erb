                  <p>Little Sunflower believes in providing a safe, secure, fun and loving environment for both child and parent.  We believe children who feel safe, happy and loved will naturally learn better and become successful little learners.  We provide a "family like" learning environment and strive to teach the whole child through all of their senses.  Through our creative curriculum and hands-on learning approach we incorporate many activities, art/sensory, music/movement, literacy, science/technology, and cooking.  These activities will help your child grow socially, emotionally, physically and intellectually.  At Little Sunflower, all children are treated fairly and equally.  We believe in using positive reinforcement to increase desirable behaviors for example cleaning up toys, following directions and using manners.  </p>
                  <p>Little Sunflower has an open door policy,  please feel free to call or stop by to visit with your child!    We welcome  feedback from our parents and guardians because we want to help best meet you and your child's needs.</p>

                <p>Across from our program just a few steps away is a large public park which has a swing and a stunning grassy playground. When you enter our center, you enter our family. The first experience children have in our space is the kitchen learning center which we created to engage them in sensory learning. Nearby is our reading center, math and science area, dramatic play, music, and art area. We have a very large beautiful backyard which children enjoy outdoor play in. Our childcare is conveniently located in the heart of Seattle, a quick five minute walk from downtown and close to bus and train options.</p>

               <div>
                  <p>Little Sunflower Learning Center's learning environment is a unique blend of different, but effective teaching and parenting styles.  Throughout her career Miss Katie has utilized many teaching methodologies to help her children and her students learn.  At LSLC, we will be teaching the whole child through the use all of their senses using different Learning Centers.  We use a blend of Child Led Learning and Teacher Led Learning.  Discipline and respect are also taught throughout the day to help each child learn to self regulate and make good choices.    </p>
                  <p>Children will be exposed to many important activities to help facilitate their learning.  The Infant/Toddler room has many stimulating materials such as textile toys, musical toys, and an area to practice large gross motor activities which will help them learn to sit up, crawl, and walk.  In our main play area the children will have opportunities to build with mega blocks, play dress up, create amazing artwork while socializing with their peers and our staff.  Our daily schedule includes a fun, interactive, singing Circle Time that will be tailored to fit the needs of the children's learning goals.  Our outdoor play area is a great area for the children to explore nature!  The children can have fun digging and dumping in our sandbox. They will be planting many vegetables and flowers in the garden area.  Our equipment includes slides, swings, tires to climb over and into, and fun wagon rides!  Weather permitting we will have our lunches and snacks outside, too!   </p>
                  <p>At Little Sunflower Learning Center we hope to prepare the children for the outside world by giving them a fun and safe learning environment.  We have you covered from infancy to school age!Children will love to learn if you give them the right environment and support.  Check out LSLC and see if it's the right place for your child and your family!</p>

                  <p>THE BASICS!</p>
                  <p>Hi and welcome to Little Sunflower Learning Center! My name is Kathleen Gallant, but please call me Katie!  I am a happily remarried mother of 2.    Our children are Abby, age 12 and JJ, age 22 months.   My husband, Jim, and I love spending time with our kids, going for rides out east, checking out attractions like local Farmer’s Markets and cooking. </p>
                  <p>MY CHILDHOOD:</p>
                  <p>I grew up in Coram and attended a mixture of public schools and private schools.  I have 3 older brothers who all still live on the islandwith their families.  We always had a lot of animals; cats, dogs, birds, snakes, you name it chances are we had it!  I participated in dance at a few schools, my favorite being Amy Tyler’s School of Dance where Abby now attends.</p>
                  <p>MY EDUCATION &amp; CAREER</p>
                  <p>After graduating Newfield HS in 1998, I went on to SUNY Cobleskill for my associate's in Early Childhood  Education, received my bachelor’s in Elementary Education from St. Joseph’s College and then my Master’s in Special Education at CW POST/LIU.  I have worked with all ages and abilities.  I started out in daycare while still in high school then went to work with adults with special needs. The bulk of my experience has been in Early Intervention working with children that have special needs such as Autism, Speech Delays, etc ages birth through 3 years of age.  I also worked in various districts and Eastern Suffolk BOCES as a Substitute and an Assistant.  My favorite age groups to work with are infant, toddlers and preschoolers.   </p>
